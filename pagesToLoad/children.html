            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>This article is a brief overview of The Lorax, by <span class="person">Dr. Seuss</span> the story of a repentant ex-industrialist who tells a tale of environmental degradation in the name of industrialism, progress, and profit, heedless of warnings from the Lorax—who speaks on behalf of nature. The book imparts lessons on finding a balance between ecology and industrial progress, and taking the first steps to righting the environmental errors of the past. The Lorax, positioned as an important ecological text, has resonated with generations. It is the generations that follow who inherit the earth, making it paramount humankind upholds a sense of responsibility and imparts an understanding of equilibrate approaches to both nature and industry. In addition, this book review examines the importance of engaging, <span class="concept">environmental children’s literature</span> as a tool for instilling a lifelong awareness within the formative years, as a strategy for introducing the significance of ecological cognizance.</p>

        <section id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction to Dr. Seuss</h2>
            <p><span class="concept">Children’s literature</span> can be overlooked as an important text for <span class="concept">ecology education</span>. However, <span class="person">Baratz</span> and <span class="person">Abu Hazeirawhich</span> (<time datetime="2012">2012</time>) note an important point; children’s literature both reflects the culture that distributes it (p. 33) and promotes cultural integration (Abstract), and as such it is an invaluable source for introducing an “ideological infrastructure that will become a way of life” (Abstract). When learning and experiencing ideas in <span class="concept">childhood</span>, children then take them into their adult years. <p> 
            <p>Children’s author, <span class="person">Theodore Giesel</span> understood the influence his stories had on a child’s insight into his or her world. Children’s books “offer a wealth of examples for guiding [their] behaviour and helping them learn social skills and problem-solving strategies for handling challenging situations” (Lacina & Stetson, <time datetime="2013">2013</time>, p. 34). When Seuss (<time datetime="1971">1971</time>) saw the need to generate awareness about conservationism, his understanding of children’s literature as a tool motivated him to write the well-known children’s ecology book, The Lorax. </p>
            <p>Renowned, American children’s author and illustrator, <span class="person">Theodore Seuss Giesel</span> best known by his pseudonym, <span class="person">Dr. Seuss</span> published 44 children’s books in his lifetime, including the The Lorax, in <time datetime="1971">1971</time>, which is still celebrated for bringing <span class="concept">environmental awareness</span> to children (Nel, <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, The Lorax and The Butter Battle Book, para. 4). His stories, although playful and filled with nonsensical words, were intended to engage children and raise their awareness of social and societal issues.</p>
            <p>As he wrote in his essay, “Writing for Children: A Mission”—originally published in the <span class="entity">Los Angeles Times</span> <time datetime="27-11-1960">November 27 1960</time>—“children’s reading and children’s thinking are the rock-bottom base upon which this country will rise. Or not rise. In these days of tension and confusion, writers are beginning to realize that books for children have a greater potential for good or evil than any other form of literature on earth” (Nel, 2012, Flood of Treacle, para. 4, New Found Potential, para. 1). As <span class="person">Phil Nel</span> explains in his review of Seuss’s work, the author “also hoped to teach [children] how to think” (Nel, <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, The Lorax and The Butter Battle Book, para. 1).</p>
            <p>A grim <span class="concept">illustration</span> of our future and far from “the brightness and laughter” (Miller, <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, para. 9) associated with the well-known author; the story’s opening scene is reminiscent of <span class="person">Rachel Carson</span>’s Silent Spring. <q>At the far end of town/where the Grickle-grass grows/and the wind smells sour and slow when it blows/and no birds ever sing excepting old crows. . . /is the Street of the Lifted Lora/</q>(Seuss, <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, p. 285). But the effect was intentional. As Seuss explains, <q>In The Lorax I was out to attack what I think are evil things and let the chips fall where they might</q> (Miller, <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, para. 9).</p>
            <figure id="f01">

            </figure>
            <p>The Once-ler, the story’s narrator, comes upon a natural paradise and the plentiful resources it holds: “One morning I came to this glorious place/And I first saw the trees!/. . . . Mile after mile in the fresh morning breeze” (Seuss, <time datetime="1991">1991</time>, p. 296). “All my life I’d been searching for trees such as these” (p. 301). And as is so often the reality, the Once-ler overlooks the natural ecology, only seeing the natural resources as a commodity he “. . . chopped down a Truffula Tree with one chop”(pp.301-302). Finding the Truffula tufts to be a great source of profit, the Once-ler “. . . went right on biggering . . . selling more Thneeds. And I biggered my money, which everyone needs” (p.323).</p>
            <p><span class="person">Dr. Seuss</span> is credited for using mnemonics—a device used to assist with learning and retaining information, which he produces using anapaestic tetrameter—“a metrical foot in a line of a poem that contains three syllables wherein the first two syllables are short and unstressed followed by a third syllable that is long and stressed” (Literary Devices, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, para. 1). Anapestic tetrameter is a lyrical meter that “plays a very important role in poetry and . . . the foot used in the limerick for comical effects” (Literary Devices, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, para. 7). Music (Carlton, <time datetime="2006">2006</time>, para. 2) and humour (Klein, <time datetime="2003">2003</time>, p. 125) are established tools for <span class="concept">educating</span> young children.</p>
            <p>The Once-ler’s assault against the, once pristine, environment continues until, “From outside in the fields came a sickening smack/of an axe on a tree. Then we heard the tree fall. The very last Truffula Tree of them all!”(p.334) “. . . Now all that was left ‘neath the bad-smelling sky/was my big empty factory . . ./ the Lorax . . . /and I”(p.337). Relying heavily on visual metaphor,<span class="person"> Seuss</span> deviated from the primary colours he consistently used in his other books. He intended “the contrast between . . . [the] bright colors depicting unspoiled nature and the grays, browns, and dark blues of the polluted landscape . . .[to emphasize] the need to take care of the environment” (Nel, 2010, The Lorax and The Butter Battle Book, para. 3).<span class="person"> Seuss</span> could have ended his tale there, as a warning against industrialism. But as <span class="person">Amy Sloane</span> (2010) notes to simply “side with him [the Lorax] is not adequate to the task of overcoming human violence to natural life” (p. 424), and <span class="person">Seuss</span> had a greater vision for his work than simply condemnation. Instead, he places impetus on action and the Once-ler has an epiphany about the importance of the child to whom he is relaying the tale. “‘But now,’ says the Once-ler, /‘Now that you’re here, /the word of the Lorax seems perfectly clear. UNLESS someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing is going to get better. /It’s not’” (Seuss, 1991, p.342).</p>
            <p>Once again we see that <span class="person">Seuss</span> has created a metaphorical link between the child character in the story and the child listening to the story being read to him or her. <span class="person">Johansson</span> (<time datetime="2011">2011</time>) points out that “the message seems to be that we have to trust our children, that they are our only hope. How can we even think otherwise? Who else will take responsibility for the future of humanity?” (p. 361). This call for readers to take action appreciates that we simply borrow the earth from our children, and, therefore, it is paramount that we educate the world’s <span class="concept">youth</span> on how to care for their planet.</p>
            <p>Within mere months of The Lorax’s publication the Keep America Beautiful campaign recognized the story’s potential to resonate with generations, and presented <span class="person">Seuss</span> with an award (Miller, <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, para. 11), followed shortly after by recognition from the <span class="entity">Anti-Litter Association</span> (Nel, <time datetime="2010">2010</time>, The Lorax and The Butter Battle Book, para. 4). Since then, the Lorax has become a representative of Earth Day (Miller, 2012, para. 11).</p>
            <p>Further validation of the book’s effectiveness occurred when the Lorax became more accessible to readers:</p>
            <blockquote>The Lorax was a fictional character with real enemies. Parents in logging communities have tried to get the book removed from school libraries and reading lists. <span class="entity">The National Oak Flooring Manufacturers Association</span> has published its own pro-logging rebuttal, Truax. <span class="person">Seuss</span>’s The Lorax has even made the American Library Association’s annual list of challenged and banned books. (Nel, <time datetime="08-04-1980">2010</time>, The Lorax and The Butter Battle Book, para. 5).</blockquote>
            <figure id="f02">
                <img src="./images/articolo2/f02.jpg"/>
            </figure>
            <p>The enduring nature of this story and the audience for which it has been written makes The Lorax an important ecology text, and if doubt of its effects still exist, consider that <span class="person">Dr. Seuss</span> is not the only one that recognizes the importance of presenting information throughout the developmental years. The oil and gas industry has also taken steps to position itself within the consciousness of children. Currently, the industry is receiving backlash from both <span class="entity">Greenpeace</span> and from the<span class="person"> Alberta</span> opposition over actions that are clearly attempts to provide information and exposure to children during their influential, early years. Deron Bilous, Alberta NDP education critic, blasted the Alberta government’s plan to involve the oil and gas industry in the development of the province’s education system:</p>
           <blockquote>“<q>Kindergarten to grade three is a very formative time in a child’s education where their minds are still developing. It is outrageous and appalling to have oil and gas companies involved in any way in developing curriculum for Alberta’s youngest students</q>, he said.” (Linnitt, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, para. 4)</blockquote> 
           <p>And that is not the only target. <span class="entity">Greenpeace</span> has launched a campaign against <span class ="entity">LEGO</p>’s partnership with Royal Dutch Shell, in what they claim is the pollution of <span class="concept">children’s ideas</span> and imaginations (McGrath, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, para. 6). <span class="entity">Greenpeace</span> suggests the action demonstrates that “Shell is building brand loyalty with the next generation of consumers. . . . to prop up its public image, while threatening the Arctic with a deadly oil spill” (<span class="entity"> Greenpeace </span> qtd. in McGrath, <time datetime="2014">2014</time>, para. 6).</p>

        <section id="Conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>As <span class="person">Baratz</span> and <span class="person">Abu Hazeira</span> (<time datetime="2012">2012</time>) point out the following:</p>
            <blockquote>“on the assumption that textbooks are one of the important tools for conveying ethical messages and for structuring the social reality of the students (Apple & Christian-Smith, <time datetime="1991">1991</time>; Helinger & Brooks, <time datetime="1991">1991</time>), then accordingly one can also see in literature written for children an aesthetic-didactic objective, by way of examination of the cultural-ideological code of the society.” (p. 34)</blockquote>
            <p>And with that understanding in mind, in <time datetime="2011">2011</time>, 40 years after the book was first published, “. . . <span class="person">Emma Marris</span> of Nature the science journal, called the book ‘a kind of Silent Spring for the playground set,’ referring to the <time datetime="1962">1962</time> work by <span class="person">Rachel Carson </span>that is often said to have launched the modern <span class="concept">environmental movement</span>” (Miller, <time datetime="2012">2012</time>, para. 11) Can it then be accepted, that <span class="person">Dr. Seuss</span>’s The Lorax is an important part of environmental literature, attributed with helping to instill environmental awareness in children?</p>
